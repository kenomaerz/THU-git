And I won't let you get me down
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh
I won't let you get me down
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground

But I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no
No, I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no
