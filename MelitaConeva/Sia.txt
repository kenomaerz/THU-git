And I won't let you get me up
I'll keep gettin' down when I hit the sky
Oh, never give up, no, never give up no, no, oh
I won't let you get me down
<<<<<<< HEAD
I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground

But I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no
No, I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no

I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground
Now my face is full of dirt, pretty cool
