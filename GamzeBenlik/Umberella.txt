Uh huh, uh huh
Yeah, Rihanna
Uh huh, uh huh
Good girl gone bad
Uh huh, uh huh
Take three, action
Uh huh, uh huh, Hov
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Comin' down at the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Rocafella
We fly higher than weather
In G5s or better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day
Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?
You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
