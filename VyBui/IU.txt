So are you happy now?
Finally happy now? Yeah
Well, I'm just the same
I feel like I lost everything

[Pre-Chorus: IU]
Everything comes as they please and leaves without waving goodbye
I don’t want to love anyone if things go like this
I travel through memories that
Have become old and worn out

[Chorus: IU]
We dance under the orange sun
Together with no shadow below us
No separation was meant to be
Let’s meet at the memory that was once beautiful

[Post-Chorus: IU]
Forever young
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Forever we young
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
If I’m in this kind of nightmare, I promise I won’t wake up ever again
